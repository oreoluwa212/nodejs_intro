I might probably be a graduate member of the Nigerian Society of engineers(if ASUU allows it anyways). I should be writing codes steady and providing solutions to problems. I plan on completing my backend learning process within the next 5 months of my SIWES industrial training. In the long run become a fullstack developer."
